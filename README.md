# Weekly Task Tracker

<https://weeklytasktracker.now.sh/>

This app was originally designed to aid in teaching assistant duties to keep track of a complex A/B week schedule. It utilizes MomentJS to keep track of the current day which is displayed on the homepage, along with tasks which are assigned to that day. The full schedule is also available to view all at once. Completed tasks are stored in local storage, no account required. A resources page is a feature to be added in the future.
